Welcome to Periodic Fable (name subject to change), a solo alchemy puzzle game. In this game you are trying to use elements to clear encounters, gain rewards, and fuse together elements to make new ones. In the same style of games such as Little Alchemy and Doodle God, you can combine two elements to make a new one, for example Fire + Earth would give you Rock. The goal of the first scenario is to create Gold. 

Encounters

The map is a grid of encounters, each with an element that is both the theme of the challenge and the element you get as a reward. For example, if you move to the “Fire” space of the map you face the Phoenix. Encounters that start with “The” are not combats and are more like physical puzzles. 

To win the encounter, you must click on a verb on one of your elements that would defeat whatever puzzle or combat you are up against- for example, a way to defeat the Phoenix is to use the word “Flood” from the element “Water”. 

If you choose a verb that wins the encounter, a “SUCCESS” message will appear, you receive that element as a permanent reward, and the encounter is removed from the map. If you fail three times in a row, you must leave and try another encounter before you are allowed to try again. You will receive a hint on the first and third failures. It is also possible to get a “half-success” for verbs that kind of work but not completely. Two half successes equals one success. 

Fusing elements

In order to create a new element, click on two elements in your reagents row and click the “fuse” button. The first element you clicked on will be temporarily deactivated as a cost. If you want these back, you can click “Untap all”, which gives reactivated all your elements but gets rid of all the new elements you have created in the products row. Some combinations of elements are not possible and will be highlighted in red when you select them. Some elements with a special symbol are final products and cannot be used to make any new fusions. 


Improvements roadmap: add final room Z (The Alchemist's Endgame: There is a shining, unbreakable door, in order to proceed you will need to provide the ultimate, most prized creation. They say it is a material that shines with the very essence of the sun. The sun is fire in the sky. The sky is clouds and air. Clouds are steam and air, steam is water and air, try to piece this all together into a metal that shines like the sun. You will need to give it gold which can be formed by combining sun and metal. ), add game ending (displays victory screen when you make gold and gift it to the final room), final room hints system (completing a full row or column gives you the next hint for the final room, each sentence is a new hint).  
Turn/move/failure timer to be displayed on victory screen as a “final score”
