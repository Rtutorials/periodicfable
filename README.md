Hello everyone,

As a part of the projects I am working on to keep myself busy during these weeks after the tragic passing of my parents, I am seeking assistance on this game I was coming up with a while ago. It was relaxing and enjoyable to work on and see it grow, and I would often keep my parents updated on the progress and they were happy to see that. If you want to contribute, open the html and play around, it's pretty easy to get started. Aside from playtest feedback, at the end of this readme there is a list of things I eventually want to add. If you have questions about your changes or they aren't obvious, make a new branch. 




Welcome to Periodic Fable (name subject to change), a solo alchemy puzzle game. In this game you are trying to use elements to clear encounters, gain rewards, and fuse together elements to make new ones. In the same style of games such as Little Alchemy and Doodle God, you can combine two elements to make a new one, for example Fire + Earth would give you Rock. The goal of the first scenario is to create Gold. 

Encounters

The map is a grid of encounters, each with an element that is both the theme of the challenge and the element you get as a reward. For example, if you move to the “Fire” space of the map you face the Phoenix. Encounters that start with “The” are not combats and are more like physical puzzles. 

To win the encounter, you must click on a verb on one of your elements that would defeat whatever puzzle or combat you are up against- for example, a way to defeat the Phoenix is to use the word “Flood” from the element “Water”. 

If you choose a verb that wins the encounter, a “SUCCESS” message will appear, you receive that element as a permanent reward, and the encounter is removed from the map. If you fail three times in a row, you must leave and try another encounter before you are allowed to try again. You will receive a hint on the first and third failures. It is also possible to get a “half-success” for verbs that kind of work but not completely. Two half successes equals one success. 

Fusing elements

In order to create a new element, click on two elements in your reagents row and click the “fuse” button. The first element you clicked on will be temporarily deactivated as a cost. If you want these back, you can click “Untap all”, which gives reactivated all your elements but gets rid of all the new elements you have created in the products row. Some combinations of elements are not possible and will be highlighted in red when you select them. Some elements with a special symbol are final products and cannot be used to make any new fusions. 

Improvements roadmap: 

Improve rules and add visuals, tutorial
Reagents wrap to better make use of space 
Save and reset game
Maybe warn player that they can't win that room with what they have, or unlock rooms when they are possible
UI Improvements and bug fixes
Basic art for each encounter
Basic website elements or security (contact, privacy, etc)
Set 2 and 3 of encounters (to be provided later), Scenario 2,3,4,5 of endgame rooms (to be provided later), randomized start.
